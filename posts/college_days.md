This past weekend, i went on a long train journey back to Lonavala, for a short work visit. It was long overdue. Even when i came in a situation to pursue the travel i was headed for three consecutive bookings cancelled before i went on the trip.

The monsoon has well arrived. Erratic, may be here, but there its “business as usual”. Constant drip throughout and some heavy downpour dispersed in between at any given day, oft at hours suitable for outside work. I was not there long enough this time, to see the workings of the wind, but its quite a thing. It makes the raindrops reach almost horizontally at you, from random directions as splashes. Your umbrellas become useless and act as a source of your own embarrassment. Anyone who has gone on a trip to _Bhushi dam_, _Lohgad_ fort in Lonavala or similar trekking adventures around the _Sahyadri_ ranges (Western Ghats) must’ve experienced this. I however went back there to my engineering college, a whole campus chiseled on a small section of the mountain range.

And the campus from its departments at higher altitudes presents itself as nothing short of a romantic dream.
